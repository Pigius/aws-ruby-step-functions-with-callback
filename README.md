# Serverless AWS Ruby Step Functions with the callback example

Serverless project example which uses AWS `Step Functions` with the `callback`.
Serverless project example which uses Step Functions `taskToken` to pause a workflow until the `taskToken` will be returned. It's a callback pattern. `AWS Lambda` and `Step Functions` were used.

## Setup

`npm install` to install all needed packages.

## Deployment

In order to deploy the service run:

```bash
sls deploy
```

for deploying with a specific `profile` (located in `~/.aws/credentials`) you can simply use the command:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=YOUR_PROFILE_NAME sls deploy
```

for deploying to the specific stage, let's say `staging` do:

```bash
sls deploy --stage staging
```

The expected result should be similar to:

```bash

Service Information
service: aws-ruby-step-functions-with-callback
stage: dev
region: us-east-1
stack: aws-ruby-step-functions-with-callback-dev
resources: 9
api keys:
  None
endpoints:

```

## Usage

After the deployment, go to the AWS Dashboard, and enter Step Functions page. You will see a newly created state machine.

Open the  `MyCallback` state machine and click on `Start Execution`. Provide empty payload (`task_token` will be generated automatically by the AWS Step Functions).

The success and failure status are generated randomly, so sometimes you need a couple of executions to be run.

### Failure

## Log retention

The log retention is setup for 30 days. To change it simply change the value of this attribute in the `serverless.yml` file:


``` bash
logRetentionInDays: 30
```

| `./src/common/adapters/step_functions_adapter.rb`        | Adapter for the AWS Step Functions with the usage of AWS SDK for Ruby. Only used for sending success and failure task_token.                                                                    |
| `./src/common/services/send_task_token_service.rb` | The service object pattern is widely used within ruby/rails developers. A class that is responsible for doing only one thing. In our case is handling task token. |

## Serverless plugin

| `aws-sdk-states` | It's a part of the AWS SDK for Ruby. Used for AWS Step Functions. |

## Remove service

To remove the service do:

```
sls remove
```
And the stack will be removed from the AWS.
